This is my implementation of ps_mem.py for FreeBSD operating system.

Personaly I don't agree that users should rely on linprocfs as a source for such kind of information (like memory usage). Right now this is just a basic memory usage tool, I will add new features soon.

TODO:
 * Get rid of psutil, get things done as they should be,
 * Some sorting,
 * Give info about one process, if told to do so,
